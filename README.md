# SPACE-INVADER

### This game is an imitation of the traditional arcade space invader game and it's all about defending the Earth from Space Invaders (aliens) by shooting them down before they can land . 
### Entire game is developed using the popular Python library called "pygame" and few other libraries like "pyinstaller" which is used for converting python file to stand-alone executable file so that it can be installed in other systems and can be played and enjoyed effortlessly irrespective of other requirements.....!
